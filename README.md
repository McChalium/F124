Updating the electricals of a FIAT124 Spyder
This is part of the process of restoring and customizing a 1976 FIAT 124 Spyder.The goal is to create a better looking lighting system with LED upgrades to the running and tail lights as well as all interior lighting. This project grew from my dislike of the original fuse block which employed the euro style ceramic fuses with external metal elements. I redesigned the fuse block to use the more modern two blade automotive fuses, but then I thought "wouldn't it be nice to have some blown fuse indicators that would light up to show the location of a blown fuse?". Well, it grew from there because a great deal of the original wiring used cheap Magnetti Marelli fixtures and connectors. So now the entire car is down to the bare metal or primer and the ugly square box tailights have been tossed out and replaced with a shape-lier design faired right into the fenders ala George Barris from the 50's. Okay, I got older, but I never "grew up".
